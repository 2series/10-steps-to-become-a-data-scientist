Hi every one, 
I hope you have enjoyed reading my python notebook.
if you have any problem to run notebook please open an issue here in github.
for most of the my notebook you need data set as input.
To use the correct data, please download the dat set from  the Kaggle site and put it in your notebook folder.
Have fun!
